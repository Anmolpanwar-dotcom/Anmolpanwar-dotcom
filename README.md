Hi 👋 I'm Anmol 

# BCA Graduate | [cite_start]Aspiring AI & ML Engineer specializing in Predictive Modeling 

---

## 💫 About Me:

 The tech personality in me is deeply rooted.

I specialise in **AI/ML**, **Data Analytics**, and **Statistical Modeling** by building projects using **Python**, **SQL**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Matplotlib**.I have a strong foundation in **Supervised learning** (Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes) and **Unsupervised learning** (Clustering). [cite_start]Currently, I am expanding my expertise into Deep Learning and Agentic AI to build scalable autonomous systems.

--> What I can do

Build and deploy predictive ML models for real-world business problems.
Perform end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
Engineering performance analyzers using NumPy Vectorization for high-speed processing.
Create clear data visualisations for data-driven insights and decision-making.
Develop reusable and scalable Python scripts using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Communicate technical findings in simple, clear language.
